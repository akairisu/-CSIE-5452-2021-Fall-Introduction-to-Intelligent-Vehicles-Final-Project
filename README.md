# -CSIE-5452-2021 Fall Introduction-to-Intelligent-Vehicles-Final-Project

This is the final project of the course Introduction-to-Intelligent-Vehicles, done by R10944015 陳法熏 and B07902062 張彧瑋.

\texttt{lane_merging_DP.py} proposed a lane management method with dynamic programming introduced by [_*A Dynamic Programming Approach to Optimal Lane Merging of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles*_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9304813)

\texttt{lane_merging_FCFS.py} implemented a simple first-come-first-serve algorithm as a comparison of the DP method.

\texttt{lane_merging_CACC.py} shows our design on how to rearrange the CACC target of each vehicle such that all vehicles can enter the intersection region by CACC without collision
